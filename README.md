- Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data
 
- **Problem statment:** The goal is to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of 
the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado with the best accuracy

- To solve this problem we used Decision tree and Random Forest algorithms .

- Random forest works best for the given data.
- Feature selection technique applied to get the best features and fit the final model with selected features only

- Feature importance from random forest model used as feature selection technique. We selected top top 16 features and able achive 85% accuracy for test data only with 16 features.


- selected features are:

- Finally the model is deployed in Google cloud platform (GCP).
